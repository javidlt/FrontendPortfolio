# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Where does the page get the data from?
- The page obtains the data from a Get call from a backend that I created to store this information and is being hosted on vercel. The call brings the projects grouped by category.
- [Repositorio backend](https://github.com/javidlt/BackendPortfolio)
